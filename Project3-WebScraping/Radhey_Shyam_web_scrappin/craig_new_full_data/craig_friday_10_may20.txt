$2500	$2500 or best offer mdx 2004! Low miles!	2016-05-12 11:33pm	
        Great value for those not afraid of a weekend project! Car had rotors and brake pads changed end of last year. Always used full synthetic oil and 93 grade gas . Cooper tires with lots of tread left. Ice cold AC! Blazing heat! Heated front seats and side mirrors! With a sunroof ! All leather 1st,2nd and third row seats! Car needs replacements of hood, bumper, headlights and a side panel. Car was recently in a fender bender at a low speed. The angle of the impact bent the side frame slightly which can be machine pulled. Did not expect to run into the situation with this black stallion so was taking care of it thinking I was gonna drive it for another 3-5 years before selling.

$10900	2013 Volkswagen Jetta 2.5L SE 39k Miles	2016-05-17  9:44pm	Selling my 2013 Jetta. Very nice condition. Maintained at VW Dealership throughout it's life. Last service was done at 36000 miles as part of VW's carefree maintenance package so you are still good for quite some time. Currently has a little over 39000 miles. I put nice michelin tires on it because I didn't like the stock tires, they were very loud. They still have plenty of life left. I just changed the rear brakes, rotors and pads, front still has plenty of life. Smoke Free Pet Free. This car is excellent on gas and has a lot of power. Navy Blue, black leather interior, 5 cylinder, automatic transmission. Asking 10900. I think its a fair price compared to what other people are selling for, especially with low miles. Also, they are mostly highway miles. I prefer text or email. I work in Staten Island 2 days a week and can show it in Staten Island after work those days. Thanks

I am the second owner of the truck Always maintained on time Truck got 134k miles on it since I had it it was mostly used to drive to my upstate house and back 160 miles each way It's All Wheel Drive uses the quadra drive system where each wheel is independent from one another. Very good in the snow best I've seen so far. The engine and transmission are in excellent condition. The body is almost excellent as well. Just has some paint flaking on the back bumper nothing major at all. For a 8 cylinder it's actually pretty good on gas I get close to 18/19 mpg in the city on the highway it likes to cruise at about 62 mph that's the sweet spot where it gets about 27 mpg I think it's great for a 8 cylinder truck.

Any offers considered as I must get rid of it and don't have room to part it out. Call Will at show contact info and leave a message if I don't answer. I'll get back to you ASAP. I will post pictures soon.

$18500	2006 Ford F250 Extended Cab Diesel	2016-05-16  5:23pm	I have a Ford F250 Diesel truck w/ 99k miles. Runs perfect and has been maintained with oil changes and regular maintenance. 4 new tires were put on in January 2016. Truck has been used this last year as a work truck and has a few dents and dings but overall is in excellent shape. Once it gets detailed, it will look as great as it runs. I have nothing bad to say about the truck other than we are closing the business and not in need of it any longer. If you are interested in seeing the truck, send me a text or email. The truck is light blue with grey interior (needs front seat covers) and has a full back seat that lifts up for material, back sliding window and 6.5 ft bed. Truck has never been in accident and original miles...very little for a diesel. Sorry to see it go but my loss is your gain. Thank you.

$3200	2003 Buick Regal LS	2016-05-16 10:30pm	This is a Non-Smoker car. I'm the 3rd owner. My brother was the 2nd owner and bought the car in 2011 at an estate sale in NJ from the family of the original owner who was an elderly woman who had passed away. He used it as a commuter with majority of highway mileage. Car was routinely maintened, oil changes every 3 to 5000 miles. What it needs:  2 front tires (treads are very low) and A/C recharge. Recent work:  I installed a new BOSCH battery 2 months ago and front brakes (rotors and pads) in 2014 with 75,800 miles. (14,000 miles on them). There is a little damage to front bumper (see pic), small dent in drivers door and small pieces of the interior door panels are missing vynyl.  Cloth seats are in very good condition. I can provide add'l pics if requested.  Overall very good and reliable transportation with low mileage. Strong V-6 engine with plenty of power.  Clean title in hand. Cash preferred. Any check will need to clear before transfer of title. Thanks Steve

$950	1996 Dodge intrepid ES for sale	2016-04-17  4:51am	Up for sale is a 1996 Dodge Intrepid ES that I've had since march 2000.It had like 36,000 miles on it when I bought it from the original owner in long island.Alot of work was done on the car this year so it's totally ready to go now.I had an idle problem so I changed the Map Sensor,Idle air control valve and the throttle position sensor which cost me about $120 but it turned out to be the intake manifold gasket repaired at great kills auto for $500.So there's 3 sensors you won't have to bother with for along time.The car idle's fantastic now.Also last summer I had to get 2 new front tires for like $300 and the rear tires are like new so tires are good for a long time. Also last summer 2 engine pulleys were squeaking so I replaced both and 2 new belts was probably $125.i did the work myself.i've been repairing cars for like 30 years but I cant fix everything. Air Conditioner and heat work great.The car has 2 power seats in front that work perfect.The car has rear AC and Heat option.The front brakes all almost new.The back brakes are still great. This car was never used to get to work and was used as a leisure weekend driving car so I only put like 1500 to 2000 miles a year on it and I used my other vehicle for long trips and the intrepid was just a backup emergency car for when the minivan was broken. I changed the oil twice a year so most times the oil was coming out clean and golden so very little wear on the engine.look at free carfax and you'll see. The metal brake lines were changed so they won't be a problem. I have the clean title ready for transfer.This car is ready for another 10 years at this mileage easily so your getting a smoking deal.This is a rare deal mechanic owned car.i don't need it anymore because I had to buy a newer minivan for my wife so i decided i would rather drive her older minivan instead of the Intrepid because of the large amount of space in the back. Checkout carsforsale.com to see intrepids for sale.There's a 1996 intrepid ES going for 3900$ at 74000 miles.. At KBB.com the price for this one at good mechical condition is like 2850$ It just past inspection in December.Email me threw the ebay mail system if you would like to test drive it.i'm located in zip code area 10312 staten island. Payment is cash.I can assist in shipping if you live out of state. The car is running fantastic. The Price is Firm. I just looked up vinaudit.com and it is only $10 for the full milage history and you'll see most of the time i only used it 2000 miles a year. Recently reduced from $2200. Comes with the Chilton Repair Manual which makes it very easy to fix.i already have 2 good cars i dont need 3 so selling this one.

$2350	318ti BMW 1996	2016-04-15  6:31pm	I'm selling my 1996 BMW 318ti. Why? I bought a newer car and now have too many cars, 3 to be exact. I love my Bimmer but one of them has to go. The car rides beautifully, it's been extremely reliable and a ton of fun to drive. I often get compliments on it and have seen people eyeing all the time. A few things to keep in mind, #1- it's a BMW with high mileage but they tend to keep their value #2- it's a 318ti, this model is collectable #3- I will not respond to ridiculous low ball offers so don't waste our time if that's what you have in mind, #4- bring your mechanic if you like, but nothing they say will get me to sell you this car for what ever low ball offer your "Mechanic" cooks up, #5- As you will see I've invested a lot of time and a fair amount of money into this car, #6- It's a "Used" car, some people seem to expect a used car to be flawless, if that's what you're looking for I suggest going to a dealership and buying something certified used, but it will cost alot more than this BMW and #7- If you want to haggle over the price that's fine but please refer to #3 before you make an offer and lets keep it real. Okay so a bit about the car now! What I've had fixed, repaired and updated: Around 2007, the Transmission was rebuilt, a new muffler was installed and front stabilizers bars were replaced. More recently, Ball Joints, Outer Tie rod ends, new front and rear rotors where done. It was tuned up about a year and a half ago with Bosch 4 point spark plugs, new plug wires and the valve cover gasket was replaced. Also to O ring where the Oil filter housing attaches to the engine was replaced has it had a small oil leak. (no more) The entire cooling system was replaced including some hoses, thermostat, water pump + a new radiator. The power window regulators were replaced within the last 2 years, Most recently, I added brand new Bilstein Rear Shocks from Germany, a new starter and while that was done I had the crappy old Crime stopper alarm system removed. (It was more trouble than it was worth) It also has a Sears Die Hard battery in it. New serpentine and AC belts were recently added. I replaced a old air intake sensor and had a fresh gas filter installed. It's got the racing kit spoilers and racing mirror housings. The color is Alaska Blue. The milage is high, 200,617, but I've always kept up on my oil changes, D.I.Y. and always used Mobile 1 fully synthetic oil. It has a few age related quirks, the after market sun roof no longer opens, but it never leaks and a decent mechanic should be able to make it functional again. The hood release works but the handle is wonky, and the gas gauge works intermittently. The stereo system functions when it feels like it and could use an updating it was set up to taker the original iPods. It's a hatch back and with the rear seats down, for a smallish car it actually holds a lot. The car has serious pep and can accelerate you out of trouble when you need it and really hugs a turn. Included is a little goodie bag with two replacement head light housings with lights, a gas air bag, (they're not cheap to replace should god forbid you ever need to), half of a plastic grill replacement and whats left of some exact match Alaska Blue touch up paint. I'm seeking $2350. Contact if this fits your next car profile. (When you call please speak slowly and clearly a repeat your phone number twice. If we didn't return your call it's because you didn't leave it or the sound wasn't clear and we could not make out what your phone number was. We want to sell to you. Thanks so much!)

$10900	2013 Volkswagen Jetta 2.5L SE. 39k Miles	2016-05-10  9:26pm	Selling my 2013 Jetta. Very nice condition. Maintained at VW Dealership throughout it's life. Last service was done at 36000 miles as part of VW's carefree maintenance package so you are still good for quite some time. Currently has a little over 39000 miles. I put nice michelin tires on it because I didn't like the stock tires, they were very loud. They still have plenty of life left. I just changed the rear brakes, rotors and pads, front still has plenty of life. Smoke Free Pet Free. This car is excellent on gas and has a lot of power. Navy Blue, black leather interior, 5 cylinder, automatic transmission. Asking 10900. I think its a fair price compared to what other people are selling for, especially with low miles. Also, they are mostly highway miles. I prefer text or email. Thanks

$10750	2014 Hyundai Elantra	2016-05-13  7:38pm	Hi there, I have a 2014 Hyundai Elantra for sale, the car has only 18500 miles on it. I am selling it because I no longer need a car. The title is in hand and perfectly clean. The car runs beautifully and was maintained to the best of my ability. The only damages the car has are cosmetic, few scratches on the front bumper, and the sunglasses holder inside the car is unable to close, its a cheap fix, was just too lazy to ever fix it, i had tape holding it as I never used it. The passenger side door is missing a screw on the body I was also too lazy to replace, so it makes a small clicking noise when you open the door. The main issue the car has at the moment is that the battery needs to be replaced, its completely dead. It's due for an oil change as well and state inspection. The KBB price of the car is 12,500. I am asking for almost two grand less for only minor things wrong with it. The car is ready to move as soon as the battery is replaced. Please give a call or text, and shoot me your best offer. I am in need of the cash asap. Its a fantastic first or newish car for anyone and still has years of life ahead of it. I'm unsure if warranties for cars transfer from person to person, but if so, its still under warranty. Car has all options besides leather seats. Heated seats Performance tires/rims Backup Camera Bluetooth Touchscreen Radio

$12500	1978 VW Volkswagen Superbeetle Convertible Champagne Edition	2016-04-25  9:44pm	1978 VW Volkswagen Superbeetle Convertible Champagne Edition. 60,000 miles / 4 Cylinders / Manual Transmission / Fuel Injected 1600cc. Very rare example of a 1978 triple white VW champagne edition convertible. I will give you the story on this car as best I can. The car was purchased by a couple in Washington state in 1978, from there it was used sparingly as a second car at a vacation home, hence the low original mileage. The home was sold after the couple passed away and the car was sold with it. It had not been driven in quite a while. The new homeowners took possession of the car, registered it, got it roadworthy and kept it at the same vacation home where it again was hardly used. I purchased the car from the second owner 2 years ago. It does look like the car may have had one repaint on the exterior only at some point which is showing signs of wear and should be done over. When I got it I had the lower portion of the engine completely rebuilt, the only thing I didn't do is have the fuel injection system rebuilt which is why the car doesn't perform as well as it should. The pistons, rings, rods, seals, gaskets, lifters are all brand new. The work was done by an expert vw mechanic in Brooklyn, L&M foreign cars. The braking system was overhauled with new drums and wheel cylinders. The window washer was repaired and is fully functional. All the lights and horn etc. work perfectly. The car has the very rare original Lemmerz white sport rims that only came with a champagne edition car, as well as a working dash clock. The top was replaced by the previous owner and is in excellent condition. There is no rust anywhere on this car other than that one spot on the rear apron which doesn't even go through it's just on the surface.  (see photos). The floors are original and completely solid. The light surface rust on the bumper will come off as its very light. They actually saved the original headliner and re-installed it. I purchased vintage hella fog lights which are attached to the car but not hooked up. I also have a vintage blaupunkt equalizer amplifier that goes with the car as well, along with an adapter for the original radio with Bluetooth connectivity. I have personally driven the car from my house to the Jersey Shore which is 200mi round trip 3 or 4 times and have never had a problem although it could use new tires. The car rides straight and has no problem cruising at 70-75mph. I was advised by L&M Foreign Cars to convert the car from fuel injection to a carburetor system which I have not done because I didn't want to take away from the originality of the car. I was going to do it because I wanted the car to perform as well as it should. We have had so much fun with this car and I truly hate to have to let it go. If you are from New York and wants the vintage license plates that are on the car, you are more than welcome to them. I can't think of anything else to include with the car, if you have any questions or are local and would like to come see the car please ask I will be more than happy to show it. When I went to start the car yesterday the battery was dead due to me not having driven it for the passed couple of months due to a family obligations, but it jump-started right up. Again if you have any questions, please ask and I will be more than happy to oblige. Please !!! SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY !!! Insulting Low Offers Will be ignored. Thanks for looking.

$5800	2002 Chevy tahoe	2016-05-12  9:43pm	
        Thanks 4 viewing my ad. I am selling my truck which I had for 8 years now. Many new parts and upgrades. 121,000 miles. It's very reliable. Never left me stuck and is great in the winter. 2 amps, 12 inch box, Sony radio (bluetooth). Remote start, custom grill, upgraded lights.. The only bad thing is that you need to open the truck with the key. The only reason that I'm sell it is because I barely drive it. Thanks in advance. No low balling. I'm not interested.

$11000	Corvette	2016-05-11  1:18pm	2001 C5 Corvette. The car runs great. The car shifts smooth with no clutch issues. Ac, Heater, Cruise, Windows it all works,only issue is HUD display, the projection is on, but it won't display. I have original shifter boot and knob that came off the car. I installed new  Han kook Tires and Montegi racing wheels. Tires and wheels have barely 1200mls. with new Tpms. The original wheels with tires come with the sale of the car. Active handling light goes on & off. If you do some search on C5 forums, this seems to be a common problem with C5 Corvettes. Dealer told me its the YAW sensor, but forums suggest replacing wheel speed sensor. I installed the  L5 2inch rear quarter panel, for the wide body look. Again the original quarter panels come with the purchase of the car. Headlights custom painted, I have the original Headlights from previous owner, not functional, but handed over at end of auction. The car was purchased with a Corsa Indy Exhaust, sounds great. Installed led rear tail lights, also have the originals. Slotted brake rotors and brake pads and a Va-ram cold air intake. Corvette has just been serviced with Mobil 1 oil change and 2 new belts, and New York state inspection. The steering column recall was also serviced at that time.

Car is great for use or for parts. The car does need work, but anyone looking to buy a 240 would be replacing some of these parts anyway: - Needs Battery - Needs Suspension - Transmission sometimes gets stuck in 1st (not often), but car is a automatic transmission anyway (Might be the TPS though) - Driver Window Motor seeds to be replaced. - There is rot. Serious inquiries only.  Although there needs to be work, the car is still in good condition and is a great purchase.

        2005 Chevy Colorado Extended Cab, about 65k on the engine and transmission, 170k on the chassis. The truck runs strong with no major issues. There are a few dings from the previous owner, but nothing substantial. The car could use an alignment and the gasket on the power steering well needs to be replaced (a new well costs $30.00 and bolts right on).

$2350	1996 Hatchback BMW 318ti	2016-04-11 11:45am	I'm selling my 1996 BMW 318ti. Why? I bought a newer car and now have too many cars, 3 to be exact. I love my Bimmer but one of them has to go. The car rides beautifully, it's been extremely reliable and a ton of fun to drive. I often get compliments on it and have seen people eyeing it when it's parked. A few things to keep in mind, #1- it's a BMW with high mileage but they tend to keep their value  #2- it's a 318ti, this model is collectable #3- I will not respond to ridiculous low ball offers so don't waste our time if that's what you have in mind, #4- bring your mechanic if you like, but nothing they say will get me to sell you this car for what ever low ball offer your "Mechanic" cooks up, #5- As you will see I've invested a lot of time and a fair amount of money into this car, #6- It's a "Used" car, some people seem to expect a used car to be flawless, if that's what you're looking for I suggest going to a dealership and buying something certified used, but it will cost alot more than this BMW and #7- If you want to haggle over the price that's fine but please refer to #3 before you make an offer and lets keep it real.  Okay so a bit about the car now! What I've had fixed, repaired and updated: Around 2007, the Transmission was rebuilt, a new muffler was installed and front stabilizers bars were replaced. More recently, Ball Joints, Outer Tie rod ends, new front and rear rotors where done. It was tuned up about a year and a half ago with Bosch 4 point spark plugs, new plug wires and the valve cover gasket was replaced. Also to O ring where the Oil filter housing attaches to the engine was replaced has it had a small oil leak. (no more) The entire cooling system was replaced including some hoses, thermostat, water pump + a new radiator. The power window regulators were replaced within the last 2 years, Most recently, I added brand new Bilstein Rear Shocks from Germany, a new starter and while that was done I had the crappy old Crime stopper alarm system removed. (It was more trouble than it was worth) It also has a Sears Die Hard battery in it.  New serpentine and AC belts were recently added. I replaced a old air intake sensor and had a fresh gas filter installed. It's got the racing kit spoilers and racing mirror housings. The color is Alaska Blue. The milage is high, 200,617, but I've always kept up on my oil changes, D.I.Y. and always used Mobile 1 fully synthetic oil. It has a few age related quirks, the after market sun roof no longer opens, but it never leaks and a decent mechanic should be able to make it functional again. The hood release works but the handle is wonky, and the gas gauge works intermittently. The stereo system functions when it feels like it and could use an updating it was set up to taker the original iPods. It's a hatch back and with the rear seats down, for a smallish car it actually holds a lot. The car has serious pep and can accelerate you out of trouble when you need it and really hugs a turn. Included is a little goodie bag with two replacement head light housings with lights, a gas air bag, (they're not cheap to replace should god forbid you ever need to), half of a plastic grill replacement and whats left of some exact match Alaska Blue touch up paint. I'm seeking $2350. Contact if this fits your next car profile. (When you call please speak slowly and clearly a repeat your phone number twice. If we didn't return your call it's because you didn't leave it or the sound wasn't clear and we could not make out what your phone number was. We want to sell to you. Thanks so much!)

        Hey all , I am posting for my Dodge Challenger . It is not a matching numbers car . The engine is a 440 not a 6 pack . 727 trans . the engine does run and does drive , however it is not street legal as it is missing some parts . As of now it is gutted . Brand new  quarter panels were welded in . All original glass . I have the hood for it . Disc brakes in the front drums in the back . Air shocks . The rear end is 8 3/4 . Bad side is , I do not have fenders for it and the floor has to be replaced . I have plenty of parts for this car . I do not have the money to finish it . Same token I do not need to sell the car either . The engine alone is worth around $10,000.00 . This is a car that is going to be worth a lot of money when it is finished . I will responded to emails and calls . If I do not answer please leave a voicemail or a text . I work during the day so it is hard to answer . The car is garaged so please do not ask for address as you will not be able to see it at all until I am home . Thank you .

$18000	1997 dodge 3500 dump w extreme V plow	2016-05-06  8:22pm	....first $18,000 OBO.---plow alone is worth $7500 THIS TRUCK IS LOCATED IN STATEN ISLAND The truck is a 1997 Dodge 3500, reg cab, 4x4, (dash dummy indicator light stays on), am/fm, ac, transmission tow mode switch when hauling loads, p/s, manual windows, ...If I missed anything just ask. As a daily landscapers work truck (lawn maintenance) this vehicle was always well maintained. it has a 2.5 yd. mason dump body that does have 3 holes in it, its an electric dump (not a PTO), runs perfectly, everything works as it should, some items that were replaced that comes to mind in the past 4 yrs of my use are (all work done at a truck repair center ("C&M") or certified mechanic shop ("Jo-Jo's Tire center & Auto)...new exhaust 1 yr, new steering gear box 2 yrs >>(hose needs tightening, sometimes leaks), new front shocks, new fuel pump "inside tank", new tires 3 yrs "still great"...I had everything done that could be done to make this truck ready for a snow plow (then it didnt snow and the next 2 yrs our contract required different equipment and so this truck was nearly never used,..5 times I think, I actually think less!) I had installed on it in December 2010 a Fisher extreme V plow 9.5'.. ...broke my ribs and missed the next 3 snow storms and worked the last 3-4 maybe...this was virtually all the use this plow had seen since installed! Truck has 126k miles I think, Im not 100% sure, I think it only had about 94k when I bought it so its been very well taken care of and not used to hell. I wont negotiate on the price because I know what Iv done to it, I know what its worth, I know the value of what it has left in it, so whoever gets this truck and plow is going to make a ton of money pushing snow alone! The ballast weight for this truck is a full cord of wood in the bed, This truck makes short work of any job! 9.5' wide,... nothing stopped it! I dislike hagglers and people who try to point scratches and imply that "these are problems"... I send em home and end the inspection right then and there,... thats BS,. so I wont put up with it! If you want a great truck then look and dont insult me. I been in business for a long time, Ive heard it all! I recommend that you watch this youtube presentation on this plow,...you will wonder why you ever considered any other http://youtu.be/ciaqNNkMIWo $18,000 obo Call show contact info

$2500	2000 Audi s4	2016-05-07  9:23am	This car has been my daily for the past 3 years and it's time to let go. The car has 240k on the clock and it's going up since I daily it, but hopefully not for long. The car is none stock except for a boost gauge and powdercoated wheels. They car obviously has some issues since I'm selling it for $2500. The bad: The car was automatic and was converted to be a 6 speed, 2nd and 3rd grind when you rev it out or don't shift like a grandma. I know how to drive it well without grinding so it never bothered me. The timing belt and water pump, themostat should get done ASAP in my opinion. I don't know when it was done last. I have all the parts to do the job but never got around to it. I could include the parts into the deal for extra money. All parts are oem bought from the dealer. I spent about $800 in parts, I'll include all that plus two o2 sensors and 2 o2 sensor spacers for $500. Also need a set of tires The car also has some weird interior issues with the windows and trunk. Other then that it's a great car, I drive it around a lot and i been dealing with those issues for a while.

$12999	Chevrolet Corvette 1980 C3|Chevrolet : Corvette 2 Door Coupe	2016-05-03  8:05pm	1980 C3 Chevrolet Corvette. Drives great & is very Fast! Comes with V8 383 Stroker Engine. Car was recently painted Candy-Apple Red. I put in a New carpet, (Floor mats need to be changed out as they might actually be the original car mats from 1980!) New battery, New Sony CD AM/FM Stereo with blue tooth, all New plugs. All gauges work with the exception of the clock, as they're always the first one to stop working. The flip-lights work, but sometimes you need to manually put them up or down. Electrical windows work, but sometimes you have to give the driver's side a "tap" down to start it. The T-Tops do not leak & I have covers for them. The brakes work good. The seat covers as you can tell in the pics have "wear & tear." They are easy to replace. The tires have plenty of tread. I just put on four new Corvette Caps. I provided a pic. The A/C & Heat currently do not work. I didn't fix it.  Who needs air when you have the T-Tops Down cruising? The car has 28,091 miles. I am not 100% if the odometer was turned over or not, but even if it were, the engine in the car is not the original one. Vehicle does NOT have an existing warranty & the title is clear. If you have any questions that I did not cover, please feel free to ask & I will answer them as best as I can.

$2500	1999 Mercury Grand Marquis	2016-04-18  3:24pm	How's it going everyone. I have a 1999 Mercury Grand Marquis for sale. She currently has 108K on her. If you know these motors, you know they last well over 400,000 miles with minor servicing. I am the second owner of the car. She runs perfectly. It does have a little exhaust leak, but that's nothing to fix at an exhaust shop. Yes, I do have the hubcaps as well. They were taken off because I personally didn't like the look of them. However, the tires have only a 2K miles on them. Pros- Low miles 1 previous owner before me Tires are perfect Ice cold AC Comfortable ride Power seat Tinted rear windshield for comfort *yes, it's legal in NYS for the rear windshield to be tinted at any shade* Cons- *Minor exhaust leak *Minor coolant leak which is an easy fix *Passenger side window disconnected because it came off of track. I can reconnect it within seconds. I only disconnected it so nobody would accidentally press the button. *Some scratches on the body. The car is perfect for someone to drive daily or even for a teenagers first vehicle. It's very comfortable ride. I'm asking $2500 OBO. Yes, it is negotiable of course. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thank you.

$2500	1968 chevelle	2016-05-02  8:26am	
        Here for sale is my 1968 chevelle. It is not an SS but it is still a great car. Originally a 307 car, it now has a great running 350 in it that has never failed me, powerglide tranny that shifts perfect, center console buckets. Car needs full resto. It used to be a driver of mine until i had an accident with it. The passenger front of the car got smashed in last year from a pole i hit during the winter when i slid in the ice. It bent that front horn, destroyed the front of the car so it needs the whole front clip along with a radiator. It will also need quarters, door skins, interior work needs to be done, frame, floors and trunk are solid, i did the brakes all around, brake lines, power steering conversion, front disk conversion, New shocks and springs all around, New front end, has done extra parts that will come with the car. Great base for a project. I am negotiable with the price. Just call me or leave a message and I'll get back to you and set up a day to look at the car. Trades welcome as well. Looking for a daily driver. Thank you
    
$1500	1976 pontiac grand prix	2016-05-02  8:26am	
        Great foundation for a car that is never seen around. This 76 grand prix sj is more of a base model w/o ac, 350 engine that runs strong, original ralley rims, good tires, solid floor and trunk!, no accidents, has cruise control tho i think the unit needs to be replaced. No power windows, leather seats, center console car, good stereo, smooth ride and a real head turner. There are cosmetic issues like the quarters need to be patched along with small sections in the doors and fenders, the interior needs some work like the door panels, drivers window regulator is broken so the window is jammed up, needs drivers door hinge bushings because the door sags. The car is no longer drivable because the transmission went on me. It was my daily driver until that happened. I priced out rebuilding it myself and having it done, to have it done if i pulled it out would only cost me $500. It is a th400 and simple trans to do myself and would only cost $300 but i have no time or money and too many projects at this moment to do anything unfortunately. I love this car and would like to see someone else take it and treat her right and do the necessary work to make her a real looker. Please call me, no emails. I'm looking for $1500 or best offer. Call anytime, if i don't pick up just leave a message with your name and number and why you are calling. Trades welcome. Im looking for a daily driver. Thank you

$7000	2007 Nissan Altima 2.5	2016-05-01 12:55am	Hello Craigslists shoppers. Up for sale I have a 2007 Nissan Altima 2.5 with 96k miles on her. The reason I am selling the vehicle is because I do not drive it at all. I've been driving my 2nd vehicle more often and lost interest in the Altima. The vehicle just sits there parked. She's a real beauty! Lots of compliments too! If your highly interested to come by and view the vehicle, please feel free to call to set up a date and time. Please, no tire kickers/low ballers. Do not waste each other's time. I believe this is a fair price. Other sellers are selling the same Altima but in BASIC/ STOCK with fabric interior and with many miles over 130+K. Check it out and compare. Basically this is a steal! Vehicle runs great! Overall, the Clock-Spring only needs to be replaced. Asking $7000. For more details please call show contact info Ken.

        Hey guys I'm selling my 2004 VW passat 1.8t 4 motion,the car has no engine issues,no CEL,no knocking or squeaking,the car runs and drives 100% and has never really given me any major issues,just the usual maintenance which is natural for a Car that's 12 years old. The car is my daily and will continue to be my daily until sold and is one of the most reliable & comfortable cars I have ever owned and still love it but it's time for me to get something newer. The car is at 150K miles but still has a long way to go before she dies on you. The car has some dings and dents but that's because I live in NY and people don't know how to park,feel free to call if you have any questions about the car. The price is at $3,900 but is negotiable but that's not an invitation for lowballers,cash is keen because I had a bad experience off paypal so that settles that. Ask for Ali and we can set up a meet so you can come by and check out the car and take it for a test drive.

$8000	Sale/Trade 1978 Chrysler LeBaron Medallion SUPER LOW MILES *Mint*	2016-04-08 11:02am	I'm selling my 1978 Chrysler LeBaron Medallion. This classic has original 45,535+ and counting miles on it. I take it to work about once a week with me. It's a V8 5.2L 318CID. AC works beautifully. Had a CD player installed but still have to stock radio. This car is in great shape. It's straight, looks good, runs good, and still turns heads and gets the thumbs up. About 5,000 miles ago I had some work done to it. Spark plugs, air filter, PCV valve, fuel filter, ignition wire set, intake manifold gaskets, radiator, rebuilt carb and some other little stuff. Tires are newer with plenty of tread. The only little issue is the driver seat has some wearing on the side. It's not that bad but you'll see it in the pictures. The body, the top, the engine, the interior are all in great condition. So if you want to see the car for yourself call and we'll set something up. CASH ONLY! NO PayPal!! I would consider a trade for a sedan, suv, or pickup. That's it.

$10000	Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 - Excellent Condition	2016-04-20  2:48pm	It is with a heavy heart that I am listing my 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee for sale. It is a 2010 Laredo 4x4 with a silver exterior and a black cloth interior. It is a great, versatile truck that is a turn key daily driver or an amazing core for any potential Grand Cherokee build. Pros: Car is absolutely immaculate and almost showroom condition. (The pictures do not do it justice.) 4x4 is great in the snow. (This is why you get a Jeep.) 3.7L V6 pulls hard and strong without the disastrous fuel economy in the 8-cyl models. Interior and Exterior look amazing for a six year old car. Serviced and maintained religiously by my local mechanic for the 4 years I have owned her. New brakes and meaty tires. Cons: It's really just the highway mileage from the previous owner. There is not a single part that malfunctions on the truck and I encourage you to come take a look. I cannot stress how good this car has been to me, and how happy the next owner will be. I am asking $10,000 for the truck as it sits. This price is negotiable, mostly due to the highway mileage. However, please spare me the $5,000 offers as this truck is only six years old and is in showroom condition. I will provide a VIN as well as other information about the vehicle for those seriously interested. I can be reached on the email provided with the CL relay, and I will provide my phone number to the parties that express interest via email.

$3500	1990 Nissan 300zx NA	2016-04-20  3:29pm	For sale 1990 Nissan 300zx Naturally aspirated 2+2 Automatic with NYS clean title It was my personal project and I'm ready to move to the next one but I have to sell this car. Keep in mind that this car has no rust because it was sitting in underground garage for over 7 years. What I've done after it was sitting in garage for 7 years: - engine flush - new radiator and thermostat with gasket and hoses - new fuel injectors - new spark plugs - cold air intake installed - water lines under plenum deleted - sport steering wheel - drilled slotted rotors and ceramic break pads - power steering hoses changed It has forged staggered Enkei rims 18" Comes with rear windshield wing and spoiler that need to be glued or attached. Also I have racing manifold headers for engine. Interior needs to be redone because it's cracked from humid. Back seat is missing. Mufflers need to upgraded or just new cat-back for about $350. Maybe coilovers to lower it more. This car is perfect for JDM lovers and slow and low movement.

$950	2000 VOLKSWAGEN NEW BEETLE RUNS FINE! CHEAP!	2016-05-20  3:12pm	Hi and WELCOME to my post! For your consideration, I have a 2000 Volkswagen New Beetle with an engine that was changed in 2014, an automatic transmission and a clean title. The car has new halo lights, smoked tail lights, starter, ignition switch, battery coils, plugs, wires, front end inner (and outer) tie rods, and bearings. The odometer reads 240+K, but the engine was replaced some 2 years ago. The interior could use some attention, it lacks a radio, and there are some scratches,dings, but it runs and drives fine. The car is parked at my business, located within 10 minutes of the following bridges; The Outerbridge, The Goethals, The Bayonne and the Verrazzano. It is being sold AS-IS, with no guarantees or warranties expressed or implied. Thanks for looking!

$2999	Classic 1987 Oldsmobile 98 Regency Coupe-36000 original miles!	2016-05-16  8:59am	Documented two owner car with only 36,000 miles! This is the first year for the downsized 98. Before 1987 the car was a huge beast. This one is no bigger than a Toyota Camry!It is a V-6, front wheel drive car which is excellent on gas. The car runs,looks and drives like new. It is fully loaded and everything works as it should except for the A/C which needs a compressor. This is an ideal car to use everyday but more so this is an excellent introduction into the classic car hobby. The car qualifies for low cost collector car insurance, and with a little elbow grease(compounding and waxing) this car will turn some heads. It needs no body work or interior work. The tires are fairly new. It was just tuned and serviced and the NY state inspection is current. Please call me on the PHONE at show contact info to see it. Please in person only-which means no texts or e-mails.

$8500	2006 AUDI A6 S-Line V8 edition (40 valves)	2016-05-16  7:57pm	(i don't mind trading for: a less valuable car, with cash; or a motorcycle) beautiful car, and beautiful ride. transmission shifts smooth and engine revs nice. nothing major is needed on the car, it runs and drives nice and can serve as a daily driver. most S-Line V8 A6s come with 32 valves, this has 40 (power). interior is in great condition. all the buttons work. exterior is in good condition, with some body wear noticeable but nothing structural. there are a few minor things with the car, all of which can be serviced. i bought the car for pretty much market value for its condition (~$7.5k) but was lied to about the condition, then put $4k into it (including changing whole suspension and most control arms) and now i'm broke (receipts come with purchase, so you may extract the warranty on parts and labor). i didn't expect it to be this expensive: my loss, your gain. check engine light is on (for air fuel ratio). this is nothing major, this is very minor (regular service stuff). if you've been trying to buy a car, you know people hide the check engine light (they reset it so it looks like there isn't one) and bam 3 days later "wtf air fuel ratio!?" - which is exactly what happened to me. but i'm telling you exactly what this is.... this isn't a car bought at an auction being sold with god-knows-what problems, that has no plates and you can't even test drive it... although 2 separate mechanics didn't notice it, because it is so minor, i'm a perfectionist and did notice: the transmission shifts slightly rough when engine's cold. i recommend servicing transmission fluid and filter. KBB value is $8,500-9,500 - please realize that cars are valued with wear on all parts, you are getting new parts with less than 1,000 miles on them (suspension is better than Jesus - you're sailing on air; engine is better than Moses, you don't need to part traffic if it's behind you). in the next year or so (now if you can) you'll want (but not need) to spend something (finishing regular service maintenance mostly). it runs and drives exactly as it is very well, so it's just if you want it to be 100% instead of 95%. if you buy any other car, even for more money, you may need to change things here and there that you aren't prepared for. if you get a car with things changed already, and only a few things left, you'll have paid the same amount as for the other car but now it's practically refurbished. this is a good deal... this is a nice car and well worth the price. trying to go for a quick sale, so $8,500. i'm pretty firm on this price. this was my bottom line. i'm losing a lot of money so you'd need to convince me that it isn't worth it. it is.

$800	1999 Subaru Legacy GT wagon fixer-upper?	2016-05-19  5:30am	Ive got a 5-spd manual '99 Legacy wagon with a BUNCH of miles on it (previous owner said that engine has less, but I don't have any proof of that, so you don't really care, do you). The car DOES run and drive, but has several body/mechanical problems. Some need to be addressed eventually, some not really. You want a car to work on? Here's one. link to vid of engine running: https://youtu.be/fHGbCvVVHEU The engine appears to have head gasket leak. I removed the thermostat to cool coolant flowing and thereby prevent overheating, but intended to get then done one day. That day never came. It could probably by driven a while longer the way it is now with an eye on the coolant level and adding periodically. That's bad for MPGs and the environment...but it's one way to get it from here to there. It needs a exhaust work, probably a mid-pipe. Missing right rear view mirror glass. Tailgate is currently won't open. This is probably a lubrication/lock mechanism thing. I think the front left brake needs to be looked at. It needs a new hood latch. The old one rusted stuck. It would not get un-stuck. The grill needs new clips to properly attach. The biggest issue one will notice from looking the damage to the front left fender/door. It will open and close, but not without extra effort. The bar that keeps it from opening too wide is broken. I see this just makes it an awesome candidate for a rally racing conversion. The suspension in 2000 Impreza STI with KYB GR2 in the rear. The front seats are side airbag buckets from a WRX. There is also a working 6 disc in-dash changer that I took out. It is availavble if desired. There are currently no speakers. The antenna is power, but broke off. Yokohama Avid tires that need to put to pasture, but will likely get you to wherever you need to keep it. All power windows, cruise, sunroof and locks are working. Come take a look. Bring cash. Make an offer. It is time for the car to go...I'm listening and ready to a real buyer. clear title in hand in my name. email, text, call. 9**1**7**7**2**7**3**2**4**7
