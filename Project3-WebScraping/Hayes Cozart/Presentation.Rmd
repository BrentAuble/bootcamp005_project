## Introduction

- What website did I scrape?

- What was the data I scraped?

- Why boardgames?

```{r, include=FALSE}
#loading data
setwd("C:/Users/Hayes/Desktop/BDS 005/Projects/Project 3")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
boardgames = read.csv('boardgames.csv')

str(boardgames)
View(boardgames)

boardgames$age = factor(boardgames$age, levels = c("[]", "[3+]", "[4+]","[5+]","[6+]","[7+]","[8+]","[9+]","[10+]","[11+]","[12+]","[13+]","[14+]","[15+]","[16+]","[17+]","[18+]","[25+]"))

## Year Game was Published
```{r, echo = FALSE}
filter(boardgames, year > 1950)%>%
ggplot(data = ., aes(x= year)) + 
  geom_density(aes(color = Game.Rank))+
  ggtitle("Density of Boardgames by Year") +
  ylab(label = "Density" )+ xlab(label = "Year" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```

## Suggested Age
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= age)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Game.Rank), position ="stack")+
  ggtitle("Number of Boardgames by Suggested Age") +
  ylab(label = "Count" )+ xlab(label = "Age" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

## Suggested Age
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= age)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Game.Rank), position ="fill")+
  ggtitle("Proportion of Boardgames by Suggested Age") +
  ylab(label = "Proportion" )+ xlab(label = "Age" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```

##Difficulty
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= dificulty)) + 
  geom_density(aes(color = Game.Rank))+
  ggtitle("Density of Boardgames by Difficulty") +
  ylab(label = "Density" )+ xlab(label = "Difficulty Ranked 1-5" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```


##Time it takes to Play
```{r, echo = FALSE}
filter(boardgames, timemin < 480)%>%
  ggplot(data = . , aes(x= timemin)) + 
  geom_density(aes(color = Game.Rank))+
  ggtitle("Density of Boardgames by Time (Min)") +
  ylab(label = "Density" )+ xlab(label = "Time (Min)" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


##Mechanics
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= factor(Number.of.mechanisms))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Game.Rank), position ="stack")+
  ggtitle("Number of Boardgames by Number of Mechanics") +
  ylab(label = "Count" )+ xlab(label = "Number of Game Mechanics" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

##Mechanics
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= factor(Number.of.mechanisms))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Game.Rank), position ="fill")+
  ggtitle("Proportion of Boardgames by Number of Mechanics") +
  ylab(label = "Proportion" )+ xlab(label = "Number of Game Mechanics" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```

##Themes of the Game
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = boardgames, aes(x= factor(Number.of.categories))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Game.Rank), position ="fill")+
  ggtitle("Number of Boardgames by Number of Themes") +
  ylab(label = "Proportion" )+ xlab(label = "Number of Themes" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```

##Cost of the Game
```{r, echo = FALSE}
filter(boardgames, price < 100)%>%
  ggplot(data = . , aes(x= price)) + 
  geom_density(aes(color = Game.Rank))+
  ggtitle("Density of Boardgames by Price ($)") +
  ylab(label = "Density" )+ xlab(label = "Price ($)" )+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#
```

## Conclusions

- Board games have been growing more popular in recent years.

- Difficulty of a game does seem to be associated with popularity.

- The more mechanics a game has the more popular it is.

## Future Work

- Python visualizations

- Make a shiny app

- Machine learning
