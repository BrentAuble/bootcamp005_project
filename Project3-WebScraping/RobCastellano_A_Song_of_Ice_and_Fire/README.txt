This project is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire books.
I scraped data from towerofthehand.com, which contains information on each chapter of the book. This information includes:
  -POV characters
  -Community score
  -Summary
  -Quick blurb
  -Characters appearing
  -Book
  -Chapter name
  -More that I did not scrape
  
The folder /scraping contains all of the code to scrape. I used scrapy and also used selenium because the community score of 
each chapter is fetched and rendered using javascript.
