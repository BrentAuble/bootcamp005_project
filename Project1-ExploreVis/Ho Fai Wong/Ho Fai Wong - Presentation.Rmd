## Introduction

* NYC Health Department restaurant **inspections, scores and grades** (e.g. A/B/C)

* How do a restaurant's **location** and type of **cuisine** affect its inspection results? E.g.:
    + Do restaurants in Manhattan have better scores than Queens or the Bronx?
    + Do restaurants in Chinatown and Flushing perform worse than Upper East Side?
    + Do Chinese restaurants have poorer hygiene than French or American restaurants?

* Data used (after cleanup and filtering): 2010 - 2016; 150k inspections (rows); 25k restaurants

## Grades by borough

```{r}
#Bar plot: Restaurants by borough and latest grade
ggplot(data=latest, aes(x=reorder(boro, boro, function(x)-length(x)))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=new_grade), position='dodge') +

       y='Restaurants') +

  scale_fill_brewer(name="Grade", palette='Set1') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.key=element_blank())
```

## Going deeper... Scores by borough

```{r}
#Density: Restaurants by latest score and borough
ggplot(data=latest, aes (x=score)) + 
  stat_density(aes(color=boro), geom="line",position="identity") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,40)) +
  labs(title='Density of restaurants by latest score and borough', 
       x='Score',

  annotate("rect", xmin = 28, xmax = 60, ymin = 0, ymax = 0.13, alpha = .2, fill='darkgreen')
```

## Going deeper still... Scores by zipcode

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=6}
#Map average scores by zipcode
avgbyzip = latest %>% 
  group_by(., zipcode) %>%
  summarise(., value=mean(score)) %>%
  rename(., region=zipcode)

#Choroplethr doesn't have all zipcodes in the NY inspection data (uses 2010 census ZCTAs)
scored_zips = unique(avgbyzip$region) #zipcodes that appear in inspection data data
missing_zips = c('10048','10055', '10057', '10104', '10105', '10106', '10107', '10118', '10121', '10123', '10155', '10166', '10175', '10176', '10178', '10179', '10281', '10285', '10317', '11242', '11249', '11256', '11352') #zipcodes that are not in choropleth package
adjusted_zips = scored_zips[!(scored_zips %in% missing_zips)] #zipcodes that appear in original data and in choropleth package

#Map: Average scores by zipcode; zipcodes are binned into 9 buckets of equal size due to limitations of the function
zip_choropleth(avgbyzip, 
               zip_zoom = adjusted_zips,

               num_colors=5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='OrRd', name='Average score')
```


## What about inspection closures?

* Scores don't tie directly to restaurant closures (e.g. public health hazard)

* Defined the following ratios:
    + **Inspection closure ratio**: % of inspections that lead to the restaurant being closed
    + **Repeat closure ratio**: % of restaurants that were closed during more than one inspection cycle

## Closures by borough

## Conclusion

* Displaying scores in addition to grades could further improve hygiene (most have A already)
* My specific initial questions were addressed...
    + Scores differentiate neighborhoods but not boroughs; closure ratios provide additional comparisons
    + Chinatown is on par with UES but Flushing is not
    + Chinese restaurants have higher closure ratios than French and American restaurants
* ... but more observations can be made based on your culinary and geographic selections, e.g:
    + Brooklyn and the Bronx have the worst rates of inspection and repeat closures respectively
    + Asian restaurants in the Bronx and Staten Island have a much higher inspection closure ratio, etc
    
## Ideas for further analysis

* Investigate violation types
* Compare with NYC demographic data by neighborhood
* Analyze trends over time by neighborhood and cuisine
* Correlate with popularity of restaurants
