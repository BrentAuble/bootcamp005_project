# Global Terrorism Database

## Global Terrorism Database

- Maintained by National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)

- A research and education center for the study of the causes and effects of terrorism around the world

## Global Terrorism Database

- A Center of Excellence by the Department of Homeland Security

- Headquartered at the University of Maryland

## Global Terrorism Database

- A highly comprehensive and consistent terrorism incident dataset from 1970 to 2014

- Data collection methodology consists of a combination of automated and manual data collection strategies of over a million media articles worldwide

- Filtered using natural language processing and machine learning techniques

# Why Terrorism?

## Why Terrorism?

![](./gallup_survey.png)

- Americans say terrorism is the most important issue facing the US

- Highest percentage of Americans to mention terrorism in a decade


## Why Terrorism?

- What is the average number of attacks per year?

- What are the types of attacks?

- How do casualties compare across different attacks?

# Terrorism by the Numbers

## Terrorism by the Numbers

- Since 1970, there have been about 3,227 terrorist attacks a year

- On average, there are 7,046 deaths a year due to terrorist attacks

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./attacks_by_year.pdf)

- The number of attacks look to have fallen in the 90s and then increased steadily in beginning 2005

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./attacks_by_type.pdf)

- Almost half of all attacks were of the bombing/explosion type

- The second and third most common were armed assault and assassination at 24% and 12%, respectively

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./attacktype_by_year.pdf)

- The increase in number of attacks in recent years was driven by the bombing/explosion type

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./weapon_type.pdf)

- Half of all attacks consisted of explosives

- 33% consisted of firearms

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./casualties_by_year.pdf)

- Interestingly, casualties decreased from 2007 to 2011

## Terrorism by the Numbers

![](./casualties_attack_type.pdf)

- Prior to 2004, armed assault was the primary cause of deaths

- Only in the last decade did bombing/explosion attacks overtake armed assault in terms of casualties

# Terrorism Globally

## Terrorism Globally

- How does terrorism look like globally?
```{r, echo=F}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))
library(openxlsx)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
gtd = read.xlsx('globalterrorismdb_0615dist.xlsx')
attacks_per_country = gtd %>% group_by(country_txt) %>% summarise(Attacks = n())
country_rank = arrange(attacks_per_country, desc(Attacks))
colnames(country_rank) = c('Country', 'Attacks')
country_rank$Rank = seq.int(nrow(country_rank))

```

## Terrorism Globally

Total Terrorist Attacks by Country

```{r, results='asis'}
plot(gvisGeoChart(attacks_per_country, "country_txt", "Attacks",
                  options=list(projection="kavrayskiy-vii")), "chart")
```

## Terrorism Globally

Total Terrorist Attacks by Country

```{r, results='asis'}
table = gvisTable(country_rank, options = list(width = 500, height = 300))
plot(table, 'chart')
```

# Closing Remarks

## Closing Remarks

Findings:

- Numerous types of terrorist attacks with bombings and armed assault as the most common

- There was a period of improvement from 2007 to 2011 when casualties from terrorist attacks fell despite the steady number of attacks in the same period

- Despite being the most common type of attack, bombings only overtook armed assault in terms of casualties after 2004

## Closing Remarks

Future exploration:

- How did casualties per attack change through time?

- What specific countries started experiencing more attacks in recent years?

- What were the possible causes in the changes of number of attacks throughout the years?

# Thank you
